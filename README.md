#Project0

This is my implementation of Project0 for CS50s Web Programming course.

In the Home/index.html page I added a Bootstrap Jumbotron, and created a Navbar from scratch using SASS nesting and flexbox.

I used the About page to list the requirements of the project and how I implemented them. This page was created using the Bootstrap rows and columns along with two ordered lists.

For the Contact page I added a contact me png image that I found searching the web, and added a Bootstrap form.

I added media queries to help fit the Navbar, Contact-me image and Jumbtron contents into mobile screens.

Lastly for the More page I created a table with the links to the files that make up my project.
